# Image captioning tool using CNN And LSTM

`Deep learning is used in our model for image
captioning. For image classification, we primarily
employ two techniques: CNN and LSTM. So,
to create our image caption generator model,
we will combine these architectures, resulting
in the CNN-LSTM model. It is also referred
to as the encoder-decoder model. The neural
network-based image captioning methods work in a straightforward end-to-end fashion. These methods
are very similar to neural machine translation
based on the encoder-decoder framework. Global
image features are extracted from CNN hidden
activations and fed into an LSTM to generate a
word sequence in this network. The CNN-LSTM
architecture is constructed by combining CNN
layers for feature extraction on input data with
LSTMs for sequence prediction. This model is
intended for sequence prediction problems with
spatial inputs, such as images or videos. They
are widely used in activities such as activity
recognition, image description, video description,
and many others. CNN-LSTMs are typically used
when their inputs have spatial structure, such as
the 2D structure of pixels in an image or the 1D
structure of words in a sentence, paragraph, or
document, as well as temporal structure, such as
the order of images in a video or words in text, or
when output with temporal structure is required,such as words in a textual description. We are
introducing more and more controlling knobs as
we use LSTM over RNN, which controls the flow
and mixing of inputs based on trained Weights.
As a result, more control over the outputs is
possible. As a result, LSTM provides the most
control and thus better results. CNN-RNN Model:
Using CNN for Object Detection: CNN yields
optimistic results for object detection and is best
suited for image captioning. RNN-LSTM will
be used to generate meaningful captions from
image and object detection features. The object
detection will be the input, and the output will
be the caption for the specific image. Image
captioning has improved significantly in recent
years. The neural image caption generator
provides a useful framework for learning how
to map different images to human-level image
captions. Using tensorflow and algorithms, neural
networks can handle all of the issues by generating
appropriate, expressive, and highly fluent
captions. The efficiency of content-based image
retrieval can be improved by text description of
the images, as well as the expanding application
scope of visual understanding in science,
security, defence, and other fields, which has
a wide application prospect.`
